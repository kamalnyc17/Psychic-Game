# Psychic-Game
1. This script picks a random letter from English alphabet, captures the key press from the user, converts it to corresponding English letter in 
lowercase and compares if the user picked the same letter as the computer.

2. Users can guess up to 10 times and then it will display "Game Over!" on screen.

3. The script will update following fields in real time:

Number of Win, 
Number of Lose,
Number of Guesses left, and
The letters user gussed so far.

4. For any additional question, contact me at kamalnyc17@gmail.com.

Thanks,
